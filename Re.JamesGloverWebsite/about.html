    <p>     JHG3 Ministries is a God centered and community minded organization. We love to help others and serve the Lord! We have many services that you can partake in such as the Monday Movement discussions, receiving A Word From The Rev. on Wednesdays, or joining us in prayer every Saturday on PRL (Prayer Request Live). We also host annual live benefit concerts for the community and provide community services for those in need. 
        Some of our future endeavors include but are not limited to a Single Mother's Group, a weekly Bible Study group, and community support through food and hygiene items for those in need. If there is any ways that you feel we could better serve our community or be of any service to you or your family please let us know.</p>
