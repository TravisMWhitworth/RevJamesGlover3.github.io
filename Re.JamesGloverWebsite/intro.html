    <p>Hello! Welcome to the page, my name is James H. Glover III and I am the man behind the ministry! Please feel free to join in on any of my ministry platforms to share in on the experience. It is my prayer that you are able to learn and grow through the word and testimonies shared here.  Matthew 28:19-20 states "Therefore go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything that I've commanded you."  It is time to go out of the four walls of the church and teach others and that is exactly what I plan on doing: Brining in fishers of men!</p>
       
    <p>+BE BLESSED+</p>                                               
        
       <p>Rev. James H. Glover III</p>
